RESULTS

For LR (Logistic Regression), the highest accuracy is achieved with Random Sampling.
For KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
For GradientBoosting, the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
For GNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes), the highest accuracy is achieved with Systemtaic Sampling.
For SVC (Support Vector Classifier), the highest accuracy is achieved with Systematic Sampling.

Final :
So Cluster Sampling seems most appropriate of all .
